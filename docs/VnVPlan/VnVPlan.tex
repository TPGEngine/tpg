\wss{The intention of the VnV plan is to increase confidence in the software.
However, this does not mean listing every verification and validation technique
that has ever been devised.  The VnV plan should also be a \textbf{feasible}
plan. Execution of the plan should be possible with the time and team available.
If the full plan cannot be completed during the time available, it can either be
modified to ``fake it'', or a better solution is to add a section describing
what work has been completed and what work is still planned for the future.}

\wss{The VnV plan is typically started after the requirements stage, but before
the design stage.  This means that the sections related to unit testing cannot
initially be completed.  The sections will be filled in after the design stage
is complete.  the final version of the VnV plan should have all sections filled
in.}

\section{General Information}

\subsection{Summary}

\wss{Say what software is being tested.  Give its name and a brief overview of
  its general functions.}

\subsection{Objectives}

\wss{State what is intended to be accomplished.  The objective will be around
  the qualities that are most important for your project.  You might have
  something like: ``build confidence in the software correctness,''
  ``demonstrate adequate usability.'' etc.  You won't list all of the qualities,
  just those that are most important.}

\wss{You should also list the objectives that are out of scope.  You don't have 
the resources to do everything, so what will you be leaving out.  For instance, 
if you are not going to verify the quality of usability, state this.  It is also 
worthwhile to justify why the objectives are left out.}

\wss{The objectives are important because they highlight that you are aware of 
limitations in your resources for verification and validation.  You can't do everything, 
so what are you going to prioritize?  As an example, if your system depends on an 
external library, you can explicitly state that you will assume that external library 
has already been verified by its implementation team.}

\subsection{Challenge Level and Extras}

\wss{State the challenge level (advanced, general, basic) for your project.
Your challenge level should exactly match what is included in your problem
statement.  This should be the challenge level agreed on between you and the
course instructor.  You can use a pull request to update your challenge level
(in TeamComposition.csv or Repos.csv) if your plan changes as a result of the
VnV planning exercise.}

\wss{Summarize the extras (if any) that were tackled by this project.  Extras
can include usability testing, code walkthroughs, user documentation, formal
proof, GenderMag personas, Design Thinking, etc.  Extras should have already
been approved by the course instructor as included in your problem statement.
You can use a pull request to update your extras (in TeamComposition.csv or
Repos.csv) if your plan changes as a result of the VnV planning exercise.}

\subsection{Relevant Documentation}

\wss{Reference relevant documentation.  This will definitely include your SRS
  and your other project documents (design documents, like MG, MIS, etc).  You
  can include these even before they are written, since by the time the project
  is done, they will be written.  You can create BibTeX entries for your
  documents and within those entries include a hyperlink to the documents.}

\citet{SRS}

\wss{Don't just list the other documents.  You should explain why they are relevant and 
how they relate to your VnV efforts.}

\section{Plan}

\wss{Introduce this section.  You can provide a roadmap of the sections to
  come.}

\subsection{Verification and Validation Team}


\begin{tabularx}{\textwidth}{p{5cm}p{8cm}X}

  \bottomrule
  \end{tabularx}
  
  




\subsection{SRS Verification Plan}

To verify the SRS, routine inspections will be conducted to ensure that the TPG framework meets both functional and non-functional requirements as outlined in the SRS. These inspections will involve regular reviews by the development team and collaborators such as Professor Stephen Kelly’s team with the TPG framework, who can provide ongoing insights and feedback as the project progresses. 

Through these routine reviews, task based inspection will be leveraged to audit the most up to date progress made towards the project. This would involve walking through key tasks or scenarios (ie: new Mujoco environments, CI/CD integrations) that the system must support, and inspecting how each task complies to the SRS’s standards. Each review will employ a structured, scenario-based checklist that focuses on the specific tasks that the TPG framework needs to support, such as configuring simulations, setting up interactions with MuJoCo, and evaluating reinforcement learning performance metrics. By inspecting the SRS against these real-world tasks, the verification team will ensure that each requirement is clearly defined and actionable, supporting the development team in implementing functionality that aligns with user and system needs. In addition, the tasks/features implemented will be cross checked with the list of issues during the review section to display how each task satisfies the issue to ensure traceability.


\subsection{Design Verification Plan}

The plan is to verify that the design of the modifications made to the TPG framework meets the intended specifications and supports functionality aligned with project objectives set by Dr. Stephen Kelly. Thus as the primary stakeholders, Dr. Kelly’s team will actively participate in hands-on reviews to verify the framework's design.

This verification will include design review meetings and usability assessments. Design review meetings will be held monthly during regular project meetings, providing an opportunity for stakeholders to give informal feedback on the design. These reviews will address specific design elements, such as compatibility with the MuJoCo integration, degree of fitness changes to the new integrations, and robustness of the results.

In addition to the regular reviews, usability assessments will be conducted with additional members from Dr. Kelly's team, focusing on the testing infrastructure being added to the TPG framework. Feedback gathered from these sessions will guide iterative design improvements, ensuring the framework’s usability.


\subsection{Verification and Validation Plan Verification Plan}

To verify the Verification and Validation Plan itself, peer review will be necessary to ensure that the listed test plans are properly conducted. The team will also conduct a review session with Dr Kelly when the project is completed. Dr. Kelly will review the Verification and Validation (V&V) document with the team to ensure that all tests outlined in the V&V plan were executed successfully. This collaborative review will confirm that the system meets the required specifications and that all verification and validation criteria have been addressed satisfactorily.

\subsection{Implementation Verification Plan}

\wss{You should at least point to the tests listed in this document and the unit
  testing plan.}

\wss{In this section you would also give any details of any plans for static
  verification of the implementation.  Potential techniques include code
  walkthroughs, code inspection, static analyzers, etc.}

\wss{The final class presentation in CAS 741 could be used as a code
walkthrough.  There is also a possibility of using the final presentation (in
CAS741) for a partial usability survey.}

\subsection{Automated Testing and Verification Tools}

\wss{What tools are you using for automated testing.  Likely a unit testing
  framework and maybe a profiling tool, like ValGrind.  Other possible tools
  include a static analyzer, make, continuous integration tools, test coverage
  tools, etc.  Explain your plans for summarizing code coverage metrics.
  Linters are another important class of tools.  For the programming language
  you select, you should look at the available linters.  There may also be tools
  that verify that coding standards have been respected, like flake9 for
  Python.}

\wss{If you have already done this in the development plan, you can point to
that document.}

\wss{The details of this section will likely evolve as you get closer to the
  implementation.}

\subsection{Software Validation Plan}

\wss{If there is any external data that can be used for validation, you should
  point to it here.  If there are no plans for validation, you should state that
  here.}

\wss{You might want to use review sessions with the stakeholder to check that
the requirements document captures the right requirements.  Maybe task based
inspection?}

\wss{For those capstone teams with an external supervisor, the Rev 0 demo should 
be used as an opportunity to validate the requirements.  You should plan on 
demonstrating your project to your supervisor shortly after the scheduled Rev 0 demo.  
The feedback from your supervisor will be very useful for improving your project.}

\wss{For teams without an external supervisor, user testing can serve the same purpose 
as a Rev 0 demo for the supervisor.}

\wss{This section might reference back to the SRS verification section.}

\section{System Tests}

\wss{There should be text between all headings, even if it is just a roadmap of
the contents of the subsections.}

\subsection{Tests for Functional Requirements}

\wss{Subsets of the tests may be in related, so this section is divided into
  different areas.  If there are no identifiable subsets for the tests, this
  level of document structure can be removed.}

\wss{Include a blurb here to explain why the subsections below
  cover the requirements.  References to the SRS would be good here.}

\subsubsection{Area of Testing1}

\wss{It would be nice to have a blurb here to explain why the subsections below
  cover the requirements.  References to the SRS would be good here.  If a section
  covers tests for input constraints, you should reference the data constraints
  table in the SRS.}

\subsubsection{Area of Testing2}

...

\subsection{Tests for Nonfunctional Requirements}

\wss{The nonfunctional requirements for accuracy will likely just reference the
  appropriate functional tests from above.  The test cases should mention
  reporting the relative error for these tests.  Not all projects will
  necessarily have nonfunctional requirements related to accuracy.}

\wss{For some nonfunctional tests, you won't be setting a target threshold for
passing the test, but rather describing the experiment you will do to measure
the quality for different inputs.  For instance, you could measure speed versus
the problem size.  The output of the test isn't pass/fail, but rather a summary
table or graph.}

\wss{Tests related to usability could include conducting a usability test and
  survey.  The survey will be in the Appendix.}

\wss{Static tests, review, inspections, and walkthroughs, will not follow the
format for the tests given below.}

\wss{If you introduce static tests in your plan, you need to provide details.
How will they be done?  In cases like code (or document) walkthroughs, who will
be involved? Be specific.}

\subsection{Traceability Between Test Cases and Requirements}

\wss{Provide a table that shows which test cases are supporting which
  requirements.}

\section{Unit Test Description}

\wss{This section should not be filled in until after the MIS (detailed design
  document) has been completed.}

\wss{Reference your MIS (detailed design document) and explain your overall
philosophy for test case selection.}  

\wss{To save space and time, it may be an option to provide less detail in this section.  
For the unit tests you can potentially layout your testing strategy here.  That is, you 
can explain how tests will be selected for each module.  For instance, your test building 
approach could be test cases for each access program, including one test for normal behaviour 
and as many tests as needed for edge cases.  Rather than create the details of the input 
and output here, you could point to the unit testing code.  For this to work, you code 
needs to be well-documented, with meaningful names for all of the tests.}

\subsection{Unit Testing Scope}

\wss{What modules are outside of the scope.  If there are modules that are
  developed by someone else, then you would say here if you aren't planning on
  verifying them.  There may also be modules that are part of your software, but
  have a lower priority for verification than others.  If this is the case,
  explain your rationale for the ranking of module importance.}

\subsection{Tests for Functional Requirements}

\wss{Most of the verification will be through automated unit testing.  If
  appropriate specific modules can be verified by a non-testing based
  technique.  That can also be documented in this section.}

\subsubsection{Module 1}

\wss{Include a blurb here to explain why the subsections below cover the module.
  References to the MIS would be good.  You will want tests from a black box
  perspective and from a white box perspective.  Explain to the reader how the
  tests were selected.}

\subsection{Tests for Nonfunctional Requirements}

\wss{If there is a module that needs to be independently assessed for
  performance, those test cases can go here.  In some projects, planning for
  nonfunctional tests of units will not be that relevant.}

\wss{These tests may involve collecting performance data from previously
  mentioned functional tests.}

\section*{Appendix --- Reflection}


The information in this section will be used to evaluate the team members on the
graduate attribute of Lifelong Learning.

\input{../Reflection.tex}

\begin{enumerate}
  \item \textbf{What went well while writing this deliverable?} 
  
  Due to the previous effort put into previous resources and documentation, our team was able to create well defined objectives with clear rationales based on our initial work. This groundwork made it much easier to develop a consistent direction for the Verification and Validation Plan, ensuring that each part of the project is aligned with the overarching goals. By referencing our Problem Statement, SRS, and Development Plan, we could confidently outline the project’s needs and avoid a lot of back-and-forth on high-level decisions. 

Developing an outline for a collaborative process with Dr. Kelly’s team was another important part of this documentation. Establishing a feedback loop is important for our project, especially with MuJoCo integration, which is a challenging area. Regular check-ins ensure that we are not overlooking research requirements or deviating from the project’s core objectives. It is reassuring to have a system for catching issues early, keeping us on track, and ultimately supporting a more robust integration.

  \item \textbf{What pain points did you experience during this deliverable, and how
    did you resolve them?}

    Some pain points include balancing clarity of our testing plan without a clear understanding of the effort or difficulty of it. Since certain aspects of MuJoCo integration and CI/CD setup were new to us, it was challenging to estimate how complex they would be to validate accurately. This lack of clarity makes it difficult to break down our validation plan into actionable steps, as we weren’t sure of the exact methods or tools we would need.

To work through this, we decided to make certain high level goals for us to achieve in our testing plans, and also examined other open-source projects that implemented similar validation processes or functionality to what we are looking for to gain a better understanding.

In addition, making sure our validation plans addressed both functional and non-functional requirements from the SRS felt particularly challenging. It required us to carefully think through how we would test each requirement practically. To tackle this, we created a checklist derived directly from the SRS document, ensuring every key requirement had an associated test or validation step. This checklist became a helpful guide in our regular review meetings, allowing us to confirm we weren’t overlooking critical areas.

  \item \textbf{What knowledge and skills will the team collectively need to acquire to
  successfully complete the verification and validation of your project?
  Examples of possible knowledge and skills include dynamic testing knowledge,
  static testing knowledge, specific tool usage, Valgrind etc.  You should look to
  identify at least one item for each team member.}

    \newline
    \newline


    \textbf{Calvyn:}
    
     To complete the verification and validation process,  I’ll need to focus on gaining a stronger understanding of memory management and debugging tools specific to C++. C++ can be challenging to work with due to potential issues like memory leaks and undefined behavior, which are especially important to detect and resolve in our project due to its reinforcement learning and simulation components. With a better understanding of these tools, I’ll be better equipped to analyze our code for memory-related errors and optimize its performance, which will be crucial for ensuring stability and efficiency within our CI/CD pipeline.

    

    \textbf{Edward:}
    
     One of the key knowledge areas I will need to develop is understanding the various indicators of correct agent behavior across different MuJoCo environments. This includes interpreting fitness scores, analyzing plot outputs, inspecting animations, and recognizing expected behavioral patterns. Since each environment has unique characteristics and learning dynamics, this will require developing a deeper familiarity with TPG's learning progression and how it manifests across different scenarios. Currently, the workflow involving running experiments, checking logs, interpreting plots, and debugging issues is still somewhat opaque, requiring significant guidance from Dr. Kelly to understand the nuances of what we're observing.

    

    \textbf{Cyruss:}
    
     The knowledge and skills that the team will need to successfully acquire to complete the verification and validation of the project include a variety of testing knowledge such as unit testing, and automation testing. These verification and validation techniques will be beneficial to easily debug and determine any failures within the system. With the use of automation testing, it will be beneficial to automatically execute repetitive tests. This will ensure consistency and efficiency while reducing human error.


    

    \textbf{Mark:}
    
     The team will collectively have to acquire knowledge in both dynamic and static testing, a few testing tools such as clang-tidy, clang-format, Google Test, and CI/CD integration using Github Actions. Dynamic and static testing will help the team to perform manual testing across the framework. Clang-tidy, clang-format, and Google Test will help automate the testing and verification process, saving plenty of man hours from the team. Lastly, the CI/CD integration through Github Actions will provide a comprehensive set of testing and verification prior to the team committing newly developed code into the codebase, saving less headaches in the future.

    

    \textbf{Richard:}

     The main knowledge areas for our project involves software engineering standards. An important thing for any open source framework is the ease of onboarding and utilizing the library. One way we can validate this is to be able to easily onboard and get an experiment running on any operating system that the user is using. The documentation also needs to be clear and concise to allow for the best developer experience. Specific knowledge related to cross platform C++ build tools, and containerizing the framework will be key for this. In addition, static code analysis will also be critical to evaluate the structure of our code. This is key because we want to ensure our code is robust, and also easy to use and build on top of since our supervisor Dr. Kelly wants this framework to be used as an open source tool.

    



  \item \textbf{For each of the knowledge areas and skills identified in the previous
  question, what are at least two approaches to acquiring the knowledge or
  mastering the skill?  Of the identified approaches, which will each team
  member pursue, and why did they make this choice?}


  \textbf{Calvyn:}

  I believe that the first method I should use to gain a better understanding of debugging errors is to utilize the regular feedback sessions with Dr. Kelly to discuss testing, debugging, and other technical issues. These sessions would allow team members to ask questions, review complex aspects of the project, and receive guidance on best practices for testing and validation, helping the team refine their approach and stay aligned with project goals. Another approach would be to browse existing threads that discuss testing issues and solutions related to C++ can offer valuable context and practical examples. Analyzing how other developers approach similar challenges can help the team apply these strategies to their own project, learning from both successes and mistakes of others.

\textbf{Edward:}

There are two main approaches I plan to pursue to develop this knowledge. The first would be to build understanding incrementally through guided exploration. This involves starting with environments where we have clear expectations (like CartPole), consulting with Dr. Kelly to understand what indicators to look for, and documenting these learnings to apply to new environments. Regular communication with the team about observations and issues is crucial since everyone brings different insights to interpreting TPG's behavior.
Secondly, I would take a systematic experimentation approach. This means making controlled modifications to environment parameters or TPG settings on separate GitHub branches, carefully documenting the impacts, and building a mental model of cause-and-effect relationships. By having a safe space to experiment without fear of breaking the main codebase, I can learn through trial and error while maintaining rigorous version control.


\textbf{Cyruss:}

Two approaches to acquiring the knowledge of both skills include hands-on approach testing with different tools without any guidance, or using online self-learning techniques such as Linkedin Learning or Udemy. I will be pursuing the online self-learning approach as I work better with structured guidance and clear explanations. Additionally, these courses often include practical examples and quizzes, which will help reinforce my understanding.


\textbf{Mark:}

A few approaches that can be used to attain knowledge of these skills are reading documentations and watching visual tutorials. Documentations help users tremendously as most if not all are usually well made, especially if they are enterprise standard tools. Watching visual tutorials may be another way to master these areas and skills through the use of YouTube, or Coursera. Each person has a preferred way of learning. They can either go the non-visual part of reading documentations and articles or visual tutorials. It all comes down to what saves the contributor the most time, while having the most yield from the content.


\textbf{Richard:}

There are a few approaches I can take to attain knowledge. For one, there is a group in France that has built an open source framework on top of Dr. Kelly’s TPG framework is called Gegelati. The Gegelati project is open source on Github and has implemented a lot of the CI/CD infrastructure and also enables cross platform development. Additionally, there are numerous C++ libraries that build with cross platform tools such as MuJoCo itself (developed by Google DeepMind) so seeing those examples will help guide me. Second, is to view YouTube videos on the topic to see how other developers tackle and approach this problem. Getting more opinions and seeing best practices in a visual format will be beneficial.
