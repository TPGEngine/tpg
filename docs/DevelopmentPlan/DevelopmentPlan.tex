\wss{Put your introductory blurb here.  Often the blurb is a brief roadmap of
what is contained in the report.}

\wss{Additional information on the development plan can be found in the
\href{https://gitlab.cas.mcmaster.ca/courses/capstone/-/blob/main/Lectures/L02b_POCAndDevPlan/POCAndDevPlan.pdf?ref_type=heads}
{lecture slides}.}

\section{Confidential Information?}

\wss{State whether your project has confidential information from industry, or
not.  If there is confidential information, point to the agreement you have in
place.}

\wss{For most teams this section will just state that there is no confidential
information to protect.}
\section{IP to Protect}

\wss{State whether there is IP to protect.  If there is, point to the agreement.
All students who are working on a project that requires an IP agreement are also
required to sign the ``Intellectual Property Guide Acknowledgement.''}

\section{Copyright License}

\wss{What copyright license is your team adopting.  Point to the license in your
repo.}

\section{Team Meeting Plan}

\wss{How often will you meet? where?}

\wss{If the meeting is a physical location (not virtual), out of an abundance of
caution for safety reasons you shouldn't put the location online}

\wss{How often will you meet with your industry advisor?  when?  where?}

\wss{Will meetings be virtual?  At least some meetings should likely be
in-person.}

\wss{How will the meetings be structured?  There should be a chair for all meetings.  There should be an agenda for all meetings.}

\section{Team Communication Plan}

\wss{Issues on GitHub should be part of your communication plan.}

\section{Team Member Roles}

\wss{You should identify the types of roles you anticipate, like notetaker,
leader, meeting chair, reviewer.  Assigning specific people to those roles is
not necessary at this stage.  In a student team the role of the individuals will
likely change throughout the year.}

\section{Workflow Plan}

\begin{itemize}
	\item How will you be using git, including branches, pull request, etc.?
	\item How will you be managing issues, including template issues, issue
	classification, etc.?
  \item Use of CI/CD
\end{itemize}

\section{Project Decomposition and Scheduling}

\subsection{Project Management}
The Kanban board template in Github Projects will be used to organize and monitor existing issues. The GitHub project can be found in the TPG projectâ€™s \href{https://github.com/orgs/TPGEngine/projects/1}{Github repository}. This board will contain the opened issues that can be moved across different stages of the development lifecycle such as In Progress, In Review and Closed. 

\subsection{Project Decomposition}
The team will be using Github Milestones to group issues based on their common goal to be used as feedback regarding future improvements. This can also be used to keep track of all the \href{https://github.com/TPGEngine/tpg/milestones}{important deadlines} in the course outline. The project can be decomposed through several milestones based on the major phases of the development, for example Introduction and Research, and Development of CI/CD pipeline. The team must fully understand each large task or milestone to properly break them into smaller, manageable tasks and to set reasonable deadlines. 

\vspace*{10pt}

\noindent For example, a large task can be decompose into:

\begin{itemize}
  \item Planning and Research - gathering of information and identifying the scope
  \item Implementation - designing, execution of actions and coding
  \item Verification - testing and validating of the implementation
  \item Review and Feedback - peer, stakeholder and supervisor review
  \item Final Approval and Publication - publishing of approved implementation
\end{itemize}

\noindent By having this approach of task decomposition, the team can be flexible with assigning roles to better manage the workloads that the project requires. This method can be applied to every aspect of the project to ensure that large tasks are consistently broken down into smaller ones.

\subsection{Task Assignment}
Each team member will have different strengths, weaknesses and interests that will be considered when assigning tasks. Issue size, which can be assigned within each Github issue, will be leveraged to ensure equal workload for every member. At the start of each milestone, the team must have a planning meeting to allocate tasks for the upcoming weeks. Each task must be evaluated one-by-one to fairly estimate the effort required per task. These tasks must also have a reasonable buffer time in the case of delays or unexpected challenges.

\section{Proof of Concept Demonstration Plan}

% What is the main risk, or risks, for the success of your project?  What will you
% demonstrate during your proof of concept demonstration to convince yourself that
% you will be able to overcome this risk?

For the project's proof of concept demonstration plan, some significant risks may occur while in development and hinder the project's success. Here are the most significant risks:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{GitHub / GitLab integration:} As of now, the TPG repository is currently on GitLab; however, GitHub is required to be utilized for this project. This TPG repository is still currently being contributed by both Dr. Kelly and graduate students. Failure to be able to integrate both changes could deal with some serious merge conflict issues.
  \item \textbf{Code Robustness:} Due to the large codebase and current unfamiliarity of the code, difficulties in testing may occur and the team may be unable to gather large code coverage within our testing suite. This will delay the goal of establishing a CI/CD environment for TPG and cause major hurdles in the remainder of the project.
  \item \textbf{Time-Consuming Refactoring:} A part of this project includes refactoring the code to follow standard software engineering principles, as this code is currently being modified throughout the project, refactoring may be a significant time-consuming task, preventing the completion of the other project goals.
  \item \textbf{Programming Language Learning Curve:} As most of the team for this project have not had experience with the C++ programming language, it will require some additional learning. This may slow down the progress of our project and prevent the proof of concept demonstration plan from being achieved.
  \item \textbf{Unable to create compatibility with the MuJoCo environment:} The project goal in the end is to allow the TPG code to be simulated within the MujoCo environment. If we are somehow unable to do this, we may need to reroute the focus of our project.
\end{itemize}


\noindent If these significant risks can be prevented or overcome for this project, then the proof of concept demonstration shall include the following to demonstrate the overcoming of the risk: 
\begin{enumerate}
 \item The overcoming of TPG integrated into a MuJoCo simulation environment by a basic demonstration of CartPole. 
 \item Walkthrough the CI/CD pipeline of the TPG project. 
\end{enumerate}

\section{Expected Technology}

\wss{What programming language or languages do you expect to use?  What external
libraries?  What frameworks?  What technologies.  Are there major components of
the implementation that you expect you will implement, despite the existence of
libraries that provide the required functionality.  For projects with machine
learning, will you use pre-trained models, or be training your own model?  }

\wss{The implementation decisions can, and likely will, change over the course
of the project.  The initial documentation should be written in an abstract way;
it should be agnostic of the implementation choices, unless the implementation
choices are project constraints.  However, recording our initial thoughts on
implementation helps understand the challenge level and feasibility of a
project.  It may also help with early identification of areas where project
members will need to augment their training.}

Topics to discuss include the following:

\begin{itemize}
\item Specific programming language
\item Specific libraries
\item Pre-trained models
\item Specific linter tool (if appropriate)
\item Specific unit testing framework
\item Investigation of code coverage measuring tools
\item Specific plans for Continuous Integration (CI), or an explanation that CI
  is not being done
\item Specific performance measuring tools (like Valgrind), if
  appropriate
\item Tools you will likely be using?
\end{itemize}

\wss{git, GitHub and GitHub projects should be part of your technology.}

\wss{What coding standard will you adopt?}
