\section{Confidential Information?}

\wss{State whether your project has confidential information from industry, or
not.  If there is confidential information, point to the agreement you have in
place.}

\wss{For most teams this section will just state that there is no confidential
information to protect.}
\section{IP to Protect}

\wss{State whether there is IP to protect.  If there is, point to the agreement.
All students who are working on a project that requires an IP agreement are also
required to sign the ``Intellectual Property Guide Acknowledgement.''}

\section{Copyright License}

\wss{What copyright license is your team adopting.  Point to the license in your
repo.}

\section{Team Meeting Plan}
The team will hold weekly meetings on Mondays at the H.G. Thode Library from to 3:30 PM to 4:30 PM. Additional meetings will be scheduled if necessary as agreed upon by the team members. It is each team member’s responsibility to provide updates regarding their tasks and raise any concerns during these meetings. 

\vspace*{10pt}

\noindent The weekly recurring sync with the stakeholders will hold on Mondays from 2:30 PM to 3:30 PM in ABB 533 beginning October 7. These meetings will consist of project updates, requirements gathering and asking relevant questions.

\section{Team Communication Plan}
The team’s official communication will take place in the “TPG Capstone” Discord server. This will include but will not be limited to general communication and questions, daily updates, meetings, design suggestions and code reviews.

\vspace*{10pt}

\noindent For formal conversation with the stakeholders and the project’s supervisor, all communications will take place in the “TPG Capstone” Microsoft Teams channel or via email if necessary.

\section{Team Member Roles}
The roles of each team member are designed to be flexible and adaptable throughout the duration of the project. These may shift based on the needs of the project. For now, each student will be responsible for one specific role and the developer role. As a developer, each member will have the responsibility of designing, planning, implementing, testing, reviewing and documenting.

\section{Workflow Plan}

\begin{itemize}
	\item How will you be using git, including branches, pull request, etc.?
	\item How will you be managing issues, including template issues, issue
	classification, etc.?
  \item Use of CI/CD
\end{itemize}

\section{Project Decomposition and Scheduling}

\begin{itemize}
  \item How will you be using GitHub projects?
  \item Include a link to your GitHub project
\end{itemize}

\wss{How will the project be scheduled?  This is the big picture schedule, not
details. You will need to reproduce information that is in the course outline
for deadlines.}

\section{Proof of Concept Demonstration Plan}

% What is the main risk, or risks, for the success of your project?  What will you
% demonstrate during your proof of concept demonstration to convince yourself that
% you will be able to overcome this risk?

For the project's proof of concept demonstration plan, some significant risks may occur while in development and hinder the project's success. Here are the most significant risks:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{GitHub / GitLab integration:} As of now, the TPG repository is currently on GitLab; however, GitHub is required to be utilized for this project. This TPG repository is still currently being contributed by both Dr. Kelly and graduate students. Failure to be able to integrate both changes could deal with some serious merge conflict issues.
  \item \textbf{Code Robustness:} Due to the large codebase and current unfamiliarity of the code, difficulties in testing may occur and the team may be unable to gather large code coverage within our testing suite. This will delay the goal of establishing a CI/CD environment for TPG and cause major hurdles in the remainder of the project.
  \item \textbf{Time-Consuming Refactoring:} A part of this project includes refactoring the code to follow standard software engineering principles, as this code is currently being modified throughout the project, refactoring may be a significant time-consuming task, preventing the completion of the other project goals.
  \item \textbf{Programming Language Learning Curve:} As most of the team for this project have not had experience with the C++ programming language, it will require some additional learning. This may slow down the progress of our project and prevent the proof of concept demonstration plan from being achieved.
  \item \textbf{Unable to create compatibility with the MuJoCo environment:} The project goal in the end is to allow the TPG code to be simulated within the MujoCo environment. If we are somehow unable to do this, we may need to reroute the focus of our project.
\end{itemize}


\noindent If these significant risks can be prevented or overcome for this project, then the proof of concept demonstration shall include the following to demonstrate the overcoming of the risk: 
\begin{enumerate}
 \item The overcoming of TPG integrated into a MuJoCo simulation environment by a basic demonstration of CartPole. 
 \item Walkthrough the CI/CD pipeline of the TPG project. 
\end{enumerate}

\section{Expected Technology}

\wss{What programming language or languages do you expect to use?  What external
libraries?  What frameworks?  What technologies.  Are there major components of
the implementation that you expect you will implement, despite the existence of
libraries that provide the required functionality.  For projects with machine
learning, will you use pre-trained models, or be training your own model?  }

\wss{The implementation decisions can, and likely will, change over the course
of the project.  The initial documentation should be written in an abstract way;
it should be agnostic of the implementation choices, unless the implementation
choices are project constraints.  However, recording our initial thoughts on
implementation helps understand the challenge level and feasibility of a
project.  It may also help with early identification of areas where project
members will need to augment their training.}

Topics to discuss include the following:

\begin{itemize}
\item Specific programming language
\item Specific libraries
\item Pre-trained models
\item Specific linter tool (if appropriate)
\item Specific unit testing framework
\item Investigation of code coverage measuring tools
\item Specific plans for Continuous Integration (CI), or an explanation that CI
  is not being done
\item Specific performance measuring tools (like Valgrind), if
  appropriate
\item Tools you will likely be using?
\end{itemize}

\wss{git, GitHub and GitHub projects should be part of your technology.}

to win a prize at the Capstone EXPO, or to have something to talk about in
interviews, or to get an A+, etc.}

\subsection*{Attendance}

\subsubsection*{Expectations}

\wss{What are your team's expectations regarding meeting attendance (being on
time, leaving early, missing meetings, etc.)?}

\subsubsection*{Acceptable Excuse}

\wss{What constitutes an acceptable excuse for missing a meeting or a deadline?
What types of excuses will not be considered acceptable?}

\subsubsection*{In Case of Emergency}

\wss{What process will team members follow if they have an emergency and cannot
attend a team meeting or complete their individual work promised for a team
deliverable?}

\subsection*{Accountability and Teamwork}

instructor for this.}

\wss{You can set target metrics for attendance, commits, etc.  What are the
consequences if someone doesn't hit their targets?  Do they need to bring the
