\subsection{Goals of the Project}
\lips
\section{Stakeholders}
\subsection{Client}
% \lips
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Description:} Dr. Stephen Kelly and his research team. They are responsible for the development and overseeing changes made to the TPG framework.
    \begin{itemize}
      \item \textbf{Role:} Main decision-makers on the scope and direction of the project. They will provide feedback on the project and approve the final implementation.
    \end{itemize}

  \end{itemize}





\subsection{Customer}
\textbf{N/A}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Reasoning:} This project is not a commercial product made for an intended customer audience in mind, but an extension to an existing research project.
\end{itemize}


\subsection{Other Stakeholders}
\begin{itemize}

\item \textbf{Description:} External French research team (GEGELATI). They are an organization that is adopting the TPG algorithm for research purposes differing from Dr Kelly’s project.
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Role:} Access to a more robust and maintainable framework for testing RL algorithms in high-fidelity simulators like MuJoCo. They may also share findings that may be beneficial to Dr Kelly’s research as well.

\end{itemize}


\item \textbf{Description:}The broader reinforcement learning research community. This includes research organizations and teams working with evolutionary algorithms and genetic programming who may be interested in Dr. Kelly’s research.
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Role:} End-users who will benefit from the enhancements made to the TPG framework, especially in the form of improved documentation, testing, and real-world applicability. The framework may be utilized or referenced in other research and contribute to further development of the field.

\end{itemize}

\end{itemize}

\subsection{Hands-On Users of the Project}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Description:}  Researchers and developers working directly on the TPG framework. This includes Ph.D. students and collaborators involved in testing and developing within the codebase.
    \begin{itemize}
      \item \textbf{Role:} Active users who will interact with the code, run experiments, and test integrations (e.g., with MuJoCo). They are responsible for ensuring that the system works as intended and fits the project's research goals.

    \end{itemize}

  \end{itemize}

\subsection{Personas}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Researcher Persona:}   Dr Stephen Kelly is a postdoctoral researcher focusing on genetic programming in predictive control environments. He is interested in how emergent forms of memory and hierarchy allow digital evolution to build programs in complex, multi-task environments, which he works on through his project -  the TPG framework. His goal is to evaluate and test TPG in complex environments, such as MuJoCo, to further his research in the field of RL. Dr Kelly is driven by the prospect of publishing impactful research and contributing to the RL community. However, he finds the lack of user-friendly documentation in TPG frustrating, as it makes setting up experiments and testing difficult. Despite this, Alex is committed to using TPG to demonstrate how genetic programming can outperform or complement traditional RL methods. He regularly uses technologies such as C++ for his work, and utilizes Gitlab for version control. He also aims to keep his project as an open source framework to allow others to benefit from his research.

  \item \textbf{Developer Persona:} Oliver is a software developer with a background in C++ and knowledge in the fundamentals of software engineering best practices. Currently, Jamie is working with Dr. Kelly’s research group to improve the TPG framework. His primary focus is to introduce modern software engineering principles, such as continuous integration, automated testing, and comprehensive documentation, to enhance the maintainability and scalability of TPG. Jamie is highly motivated to refactor the TPG codebase to make it more user-friendly for other researchers and contributors. However, he will have to balance the challenge of modernizing the codebase without disrupting the existing functionality or performance of TPG, especially without the full context of the system when he starts to work on it. Additionally, he will also be contributing to work on extending TPG to be integrated with Mujoco, an advanced physics simulator. He will be doing research on the best ways to create an integration between the two systems.

  \end{itemize}
\subsection{Priorities Assigned to Users}

\textbf{N/A}

\subsection{User Participation}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Hands-on users (researchers and developers) will be actively involved throughout the project lifecycle, providing feedback on codebase refactoring, testing, CI development and the MuJoCo integration.


  \item Frequent discussions with the Dr. Kelly and the research team during the development process, with periodic reviews at project milestones.

  \item The reinforcement learning community or other research organizations may provide indirect feedback post-development through research papers, informal discussion, and open-source contributions


  \end{itemize}
\subsection{Maintenance Users and Service Technicians}
The future maintainers of the TPG framework will likely be within Dr. Kelly’s research group or external contributors from the open-source community, will handle ongoing updates, bug fixes, and enhancements. User documentation will be provided to help improve the maintainability of the project.
