\section{Mandated Constraints}

\subsection{Solution Constraints}
The solution must strictly adhere to modern software engineering best practices, including comprehensive documentation, robust testing, and the implementation of continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipelines. The implementation must be in C++ to maintain compatibility with the existing Tangled Program Graphs (TPG) codebase. The system must integrate seamlessly with MuJoCo, a physics engine developed by Google DeepMind, to enable testing in dynamic and partially observable environments. All code contributions must comply with open-source licensing agreements and standards to facilitate community collaboration. Additionally, the solution should minimize computational resource requirements to support deployment on embedded systems with limited processing capabilities.

\subsection{Implementation Environment of the Current System}
The current TPG framework is implemented in C++. MuJoCo is originally written in C, and its core API is in C, so interacting with C++ is a good option. Development will occur in a UNIX-like environment with as much standardization as possible. Virtualization environments such as Docker, VSCode Dev Containers, WSL, and VMs will be considered based on the ease of environment standardization across the team. OpenGL will be used to display the RL simulation, so display compatibility with the virtualization environments will need to be considered.

\subsection{Partner or Collaborative Applications}
The solution should maintain or improve compatibility with applications or tools used by secondary stakeholders, such as the GEGELATI team, who utilize TPG for their research purposes. This includes ensuring interoperability with their existing frameworks and facilitating data exchange where necessary.

\subsection{Off-the-Shelf Software}
The project may utilize off-the-shelf software components to enhance functionality and reduce development time. Potential components include physics engines like MuJoCo and unit testing libraries such as Catch or Google Test. All off-the-shelf software used must be compatible with the project's open-source licensing and should not introduce dependencies that conflict with the solution constraints. See section 19 for further analysis of potential off-the-shelf software integrations.

\subsection{Anticipated Workplace Environment}
Development will utilize standard C++ development tools, compilers, debuggers, and possibly integrated development environments (IDEs). The team will work in a collaborative environment, employing version control systems like GitHub to manage code contributions and facilitate communication among team members. Meetings with our supervisor, Dr. Kelly, and amongst the team will be default in-person. Modes of communication have been discussed in further detail in the Development Plan document.

\subsection{Schedule Constraints}
The project must be completed according to the deadlines listed in the capstone course outline, aligning with team availability and academic schedules. Key milestones include the early implementation of the CI/CD pipeline to facilitate subsequent testing and development. Achieving the target code coverage is critical and should be scheduled with sufficient time for iterative testing. Integrating MuJoCo should be prioritized to allow ample time for experimentation and evaluation. Time must be allocated for conducting experiments and analyzing results before project completion.

\subsection{Budget Constraints}
The project operates under tight or nonexistent budget constraints, typical of academic projects. Any costs associated with software licenses must be minimized or covered through academic licensing options. Expenditures on additional hardware or paid tools are constrained and must be justified or avoided if possible.

\subsection{Enterprise Constraints}
The solution must comply with university policies, academic integrity standards, and any guidelines provided by the supervising faculty. All development must adhere to the policies regarding intellectual property and open-source contributions.

\section{Relevant Facts And Assumptions}
\subsection{Relevant Facts}
The Tangled Program Graphs (TPG) framework is currently implemented in C++ and is utilized for genetic programming in reinforcement learning (RL) environments. The existing codebase lacks comprehensive documentation, testing suites, and continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipelines, which hinders its usability and maintainability. Additionally, the integration of MuJoCo, a physics engine developed by Google DeepMind, is intended to enhance the TPG framework by enabling testing in dynamic and partially observable environments.

\subsection{Business Rules}
All code contributions must comply with open-source licensing agreements, such as the MIT license, to ensure that the framework remains accessible to researchers and developers. Secondly, any modifications to the codebase must be accompanied by comprehensive documentation and testing to maintain high standards of quality and usability, meeting the requirements of rigorous scientific research. Additionally, the project must implement a continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipeline to automate testing and deployment processes, ensuring that all changes are validated before integration into the main codebase.

\subsection{Assumptions}
It is assumed that all team members possess a working knowledge of C++ and are familiar with software engineering best practices. Furthermore, it is expected that the necessary computing resources and development tools will be available and accessible to the team throughout the project duration. The integration of MuJoCo into the TPG framework is presumed to be feasible without encountering insurmountable licensing or technical impediments. Additionally, it is anticipated that external contributors from Dr. Kelly's research group may become involved after the development phase, necessitating clear guidelines and documentation for collaboration.

\section{Open Issues}
The integration of TPG (Tangled Program Graphs) with MuJoCo presents significant challenges, particularly regarding the complexity of the integration process. The current TPG implementation is primarily designed for simpler environments, and adapting it to MuJoCo's physics-based simulations may require substantial modifications to the TPG class and its components. Additionally, the state representation in MuJoCo environments is often high-dimensional and continuous, necessitating adaptations in TPG to efficiently handle these more complex state representations. Furthermore, the action space compatibility poses another challenge, as TPG currently supports discrete action spaces, while MuJoCo typically requires continuous action spaces, which may necessitate changes to the action selection and execution mechanisms within TPG.

Performance optimization is crucial, as the computational demands of MuJoCo simulations combined with TPG's evolutionary approach could lead to significant runtime issues. This necessitates exploring optimization strategies to ensure reasonable training and execution times. Moreover, the memory management strategies employed in TPG, which utilize various memory structures such as working\_memory\_ and const\_memory\_, may need to be reassessed to efficiently store and manipulate the potentially large state spaces encountered in MuJoCo environments. The scalability of genetic operations within TPG also requires attention, as the existing mutation and crossover mechanisms may need adaptation to effectively work with the increased complexity of MuJoCo tasks, impacting convergence and learning speed.

Handling partial observability is another critical aspect, as TPG has mechanisms for this, but their effectiveness in the more complex, physics-based scenarios of MuJoCo remains uncertain. Additionally, the integration may complicate debugging and visualization efforts, making it challenging to analyze the TPG's decision-making process. New tools or approaches may be necessary to facilitate effective development and analysis. Finally, the development of comprehensive test suites for the integrated TPG-MuJoCo system will be challenging due to the increased complexity and stochastic nature of the environments, necessitating careful consideration to ensure robust performance across a wide range of scenarios.
