\maketitle

% \plt{Reflection is an important component of getting the full benefits from a
% learning experience. Besides the intrinsic benefits of reflection, this
% document will be used to help the TAs grade how well your team responded to
% feedback. Therefore, traceability between Revision 0 and Revision 1 is an
% important part of the reflection exercise. In addition, several CEAB (Canadian
% Engineering Accreditation Board) Learning Outcomes (LOs) will be assessed based
% on your reflections.}

\section{Changes in Response to Feedback}
This section summarizes the changes made over the course of the capstone project in response to
feedback from sources such as TAs, the supervisor and other teams. The associated commits can be
found by clicking on the associated issue created.

% \plt{Summarize the changes made over the course of the project in response to
% feedback from TAs, the instructor, teammates, other teams, the project
% supervisor (if present), and from user testers.}

% \plt{For those teams with an external supervisor, please highlight how the feedback 
% from the supervisor shaped your project.  In particular, you should highlight the 
% supervisor's response to your Rev 0 demonstration to them.}

% \plt{Version control can make the summary relatively easy, if you used issues
% and meaningful commits.  If you feedback is in an issue, and you responded in
% the issue tracker, you can point to the issue as part of explaining your
% changes.  If addressing the issue required changes to code or documentation, you
% can point to the specific commit that made the changes.  Although the links are
% helpful for the details, you should include a label for each item of feedback so
% that the reader has an idea of what each item is about without the need to click
% on everything to find out.}

% \plt{If you were not organized with your commits, traceability between feedback
% and commits will not be feasible to capture after the fact.  You will instead
% need to spend time writing down a summary of the changes made in response to
% each item of feedback.}

% \plt{You should address EVERY item of feedback.  A table or itemized list is
% recommended.  You should record every item of feedback, along with the source of
% that feedback and the change you made in response to that feedback.  The
% response can be a change to your documentation, code, or development process.
% The response can also be the reason why no changes were made in response to the
% feedback.  To make this information manageable, you will record the feedback and
% response separately for each deliverable in the sections that follow.}

% \plt{If the feedback is general or incomplete, the TA (or instructor) will not
% be able to grade your response to feedback.  In that case your grade on this
% document, and likely the Revision 1 versions of the other documents will be
% low.}

\subsection{VnV Plan and Report}

\section{Challenge Level and Extras}

\subsection{Challenge Level}
The challenge level of the project is \textbf{advanced} as agreed upon by the course instructor since this project is an extension of the current Tangled Program Graphs repository created by Dr. Stephen Kelly.

\subsection{Extras}
The extra tackled by this project is a Research Report. This report will cover the research and results obtained from incorporating dynamic memory to enhance reinforcement learning within MuJoCo using Tangled Program Graphs.
It explores this through single-task (STL) and multi-task (MTL) experiments on MuJoCo environments such as Inverted Pendulum, Half Cheetah, and Humanoid Standup.
The Research Report can be found \href{https://github.com/TPGEngine/tpg/blob/main/docs/Extras/ResearchReport(Advanced)/ResearchReport.pdf}{here}.

\section{Design Iteration (LO11 (PrototypeIterate))}

\plt{Explain how you arrived at your final design and implementation.  How did
the design evolve from the first version to the final version?} 

\plt{Don't just say what you changed, say why you changed it.  The needs of the
client should be part of the explanation.  For example, if you made changes in
response to usability testing, explain what the testing found and what changes
it led to.}

\section{Design Decisions (LO12)}

\plt{Reflect and justify your design decisions.  How did limitations,
 assumptions, and constraints influence your decisions?  Discuss each of these
 separately.}

\section{Economic Considerations (LO23)}

Since the project will eventually be open-sourced once the research work is finished, its primary market does
not include direct commercial sales but rather the research community, AI practitioners, and robotics engineers 
and enthusiasts. 

Attracting users will require a combination of strategies to enhance community engagement,
increase project visibility, and improve usability. A few key approaches are:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Open-Source Repository}: Hosting the project on GitHub with a well-organized README, issue tracker and contribution
        guidelines would encourage potential contributors.
    \item \textbf{Conference \& Workshop Presentations}: Presenting the project at ML and robotic conferences such as GECCO and Conference
        on Artificial Life would increase its visibility among researchers.
    \item \textbf{Publishing Research \& Documentation}: Continue releasing research papers and technical reports explaining TPG's 
        capabalities and how well it compares with alternatives.
    \item \textbf{Showcasing Notable Results}: Publishing blog posts, YouTube videos, as well as engaging with the reinforcement learning community
        through Hugging Face forums, GitHub discussions, Reddit and other online platforms. 
\end{itemize}

TPG's potential lies in academic research, robotics applications, and open-source adoption. The long-term strategy 
would focus on gaining traction in research and industry collaborations, which could lead to funding opportunities, 
grants, or potential commercial applications in reinforcement learning for real-world robotic systems.

While it's difficult to estimate exact numbers of potential users, open-source RL-based GitHub projects often have
thousands of users. For example, OpenAI's Gym has 35.6k stars GitHub, while Stable Baselines3 has around 10.2k stars. Given 
TPG's unique focus, it has the potential to attract a niche but highly engaged user base of researchers, engineers, 
and developers in the AI and robotics space.

\section{Reflection on Project Management (LO24)}

\plt{This question focuses on processes and tools used for project management.}

\subsection{How Does Your Project Management Compare to Your Development Plan}

\plt{Did you follow your Development plan, with respect to the team meeting plan, 
team communication plan, team member roles and workflow plan.  Did you use the 
technology you planned on using?}

\subsection{What Went Well?}

\plt{What went well for your project management in terms of processes and 
technology?}

\subsection{What Went Wrong?}

\plt{What went wrong in terms of processes and technology?}

\subsection{What Would you Do Differently Next Time?}

\plt{What will you do differently for your next project?}

\section{Reflection on Capstone}

\plt{This question focuses on what you learned during the course of the capstone project.}

\subsection{Which Courses Were Relevant}

\plt{Which of the courses you have taken were relevant for the capstone project?}

\subsection{Knowledge/Skills Outside of Courses}

\plt{What skills/knowledge did you need to acquire for your capstone project
that was outside of the courses you took?}
