\maketitle

% \plt{Reflection is an important component of getting the full benefits from a
% learning experience. Besides the intrinsic benefits of reflection, this
% document will be used to help the TAs grade how well your team responded to
% feedback. Therefore, traceability between Revision 0 and Revision 1 is an
% important part of the reflection exercise. In addition, several CEAB (Canadian
% Engineering Accreditation Board) Learning Outcomes (LOs) will be assessed based
% on your reflections.}

\section{Changes in Response to Feedback}
This section summarizes the changes made over the course of the capstone project in response to
feedback from sources such as TAs, the supervisor and other teams. The associated commits can be
found by clicking on the associated issue created.

% \plt{Summarize the changes made over the course of the project in response to
% feedback from TAs, the instructor, teammates, other teams, the project
% supervisor (if present), and from user testers.}

% \plt{For those teams with an external supervisor, please highlight how the feedback 
% from the supervisor shaped your project.  In particular, you should highlight the 
% supervisor's response to your Rev 0 demonstration to them.}

% \plt{Version control can make the summary relatively easy, if you used issues
% and meaningful commits.  If you feedback is in an issue, and you responded in
% the issue tracker, you can point to the issue as part of explaining your
% changes.  If addressing the issue required changes to code or documentation, you
% can point to the specific commit that made the changes.  Although the links are
% helpful for the details, you should include a label for each item of feedback so
% that the reader has an idea of what each item is about without the need to click
% on everything to find out.}

% \plt{If you were not organized with your commits, traceability between feedback
% and commits will not be feasible to capture after the fact.  You will instead
% need to spend time writing down a summary of the changes made in response to
% each item of feedback.}

% \plt{You should address EVERY item of feedback.  A table or itemized list is
% recommended.  You should record every item of feedback, along with the source of
% that feedback and the change you made in response to that feedback.  The
% response can be a change to your documentation, code, or development process.
% The response can also be the reason why no changes were made in response to the
% feedback.  To make this information manageable, you will record the feedback and
% response separately for each deliverable in the sections that follow.}

% \plt{If the feedback is general or incomplete, the TA (or instructor) will not
% be able to grade your response to feedback.  In that case your grade on this
% document, and likely the Revision 1 versions of the other documents will be
% low.}

\subsection{VnV Plan and Report}

\section{Challenge Level and Extras}

\subsection{Challenge Level}
The challenge level of the project is \textbf{advanced} as agreed upon by the course instructor since this project is an extension of the current Tangled Program Graphs repository created by Dr. Stephen Kelly.

\subsection{Extras}
The extra tackled by this project is a Research Report. This report will cover the research and results obtained from incorporating dynamic memory to enhance reinforcement learning within MuJoCo using Tangled Program Graphs.
It explores this through single-task (STL) and multi-task (MTL) experiments on MuJoCo environments such as Inverted Pendulum, Half Cheetah, and Humanoid Standup.
The Research Report can be found \href{https://github.com/TPGEngine/tpg/blob/main/docs/Extras/ResearchReport(Advanced)/ResearchReport.pdf}{here}.

\section{Design Iteration (LO11 (PrototypeIterate))}

The design and implementation of our capstone project were driven by the needs of our client, Dr. Kelly, and his research group. As contributors to their existing \href{https://gitlab.cas.mcmaster.ca/kellys32/tpg}{codebase}, our efforts focused on addressing pain points in current workflows and enhancing the overall developer experience, aligning with the goal of facilitating research on the TPG framework within more complex environments.

\subsection{MuJoCo Environment Integration and Expansion}

Our initial work involved integrating MuJoCo environments to expand the capabilities of the TPG framework. Dr. Kelly's group had previously implemented the "Ant" environment. Recognizing the need to evaluate the TPG framework in more advanced physics engines, we implemented support for additional environments such as Inverted Pendulum, Humanoid Standup, and Half Cheetah. This directly addressed Dr. Kelly's desire to transition to MuJoCo, enabling experimentation within more sophisticated and realistic simulations.

This effort culminated in addressing Dr. Kelly's primary research question: evaluating TPG's performance in multi-task scenarios. Building upon the individual environment implementations, we iterated on combining MuJoCo environments, enabling the evolution of policies capable of learning across multiple tasks. This progression demonstrates a clear evolution driven by the client's research objectives, moving from basic integration to tackling more complex, multi-task learning problems.

\subsection{Migration to .csv Logging}

A significant change involved modifying the logging system. Dr. Kelly expressed a desire to transition data analysis processing from R to Python-based tools, citing maintainability and the flexibility of Python libraries as key motivations. To accommodate this transition, we migrated the logging format from \texttt{.std} and \texttt{.err} files to \texttt{.csv} files.

The choice of \texttt{.csv} over the previous \texttt{.std} format offers several advantages from the perspective of user needs:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Organization:} \texttt{.csv} files provide a structured, tabular format. This makes it easier to import and analyze data using Python libraries like Pandas, streamlining the data processing pipeline. The previous \texttt{.std} format required more complex parsing and was less amenable to automated analysis.
    \item \textbf{Accessibility:} \texttt{.csv} is a widely supported and easily accessible format. Researchers can readily open and manipulate \texttt{.csv} files in various software packages, fostering collaboration and simplifying data sharing.
    \item \textbf{Specific Metric Capture:} We designed the \texttt{.csv} logs to capture specific metrics from each stage of the evolutionary process. This allows for targeted analysis of performance and behavior, providing Dr. Kelly and his team with the data they need to evaluate the TPG framework effectively.
\end{itemize}

By migrating to \texttt{.csv} logs, we not only accommodated Dr. Kelly's preference for Python-based tools but also improved the organization, accessibility, and analytical potential of the logged data, directly benefiting the research workflow.

\subsection{CLI Tool Development}

Initially, the execution of experiments relied on script-based execution, requiring developers to navigate to specific directories and execute commands with specific parameters. This workflow was identified as a pain point, particularly when running multiple experiments concurrently.

In response to this usability issue, we developed a Command Line Interface (CLI) tool to simplify experiment execution. This change was presented to Dr. Kelly, who agreed that a streamlined workflow would significantly improve the developer experience.

The initial "MVP" version of the CLI tool supported essential functions such as:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \texttt{tpg evolve [environment]}: Evolving a policy for a given environment.
    \item \texttt{tpg replay [environment]}: Replaying the best-performing agent in an environment.
    \item \texttt{tpg plot [environment]}: Plotting relevant statistics.
\end{itemize}

These commands mirrored the functionality of the original scripts but offered a more intuitive and descriptive interface. After merging the initial version and providing documentation, Dr. Kelly's research group provided valuable feedback. They requested additional functionality, such as:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \texttt{tpg clean}: Removing old log files to maintain a clean working environment.
    \item \texttt{tpg kill}: Terminating MPI processes.
\end{itemize}

Based on this feedback, we iterated on the CLI tool, incorporating these new features to further streamline the user experience and address the specific needs of the research team. The final CLI tool represents a significant improvement in usability, allowing researchers to execute, manage, and analyze experiments with greater ease and efficiency.

In summary, our design iterations were continuously guided by the needs of Dr. Kelly and his research group. By focusing on improving existing workflows, accommodating new technologies, and responding to user feedback, we were able to develop a system that directly supports their research goals and enhances the overall developer experience.


\section{Design Decisions (LO12)}

\plt{Reflect and justify your design decisions.  How did limitations,
 assumptions, and constraints influence your decisions?  Discuss each of these
 separately.}

\section{Economic Considerations (LO23)}

Since the project will eventually be open-sourced once the research work is finished, its primary market does
not include direct commercial sales but rather the research community, AI practitioners, and robotics engineers 
and enthusiasts. 

Attracting users will require a combination of strategies to enhance community engagement,
increase project visibility, and improve usability. A few key approaches are:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Open-Source Repository}: Hosting the project on GitHub with a well-organized README, issue tracker and contribution
        guidelines would encourage potential contributors.
    \item \textbf{Conference \& Workshop Presentations}: Presenting the project at ML and robotic conferences such as GECCO and Conference
        on Artificial Life would increase its visibility among researchers.
    \item \textbf{Publishing Research \& Documentation}: Continue releasing research papers and technical reports explaining TPG's 
        capabalities and how well it compares with alternatives.
    \item \textbf{Showcasing Notable Results}: Publishing blog posts, YouTube videos, as well as engaging with the reinforcement learning community
        through Hugging Face forums, GitHub discussions, Reddit and other online platforms. 
\end{itemize}

TPG's potential lies in academic research, robotics applications, and open-source adoption. The long-term strategy 
would focus on gaining traction in research and industry collaborations, which could lead to funding opportunities, 
grants, or potential commercial applications in reinforcement learning for real-world robotic systems.

While it's difficult to estimate exact numbers of potential users, open-source RL-based GitHub projects often have
thousands of users. For example, OpenAI's Gym has 35.6k stars GitHub, while Stable Baselines3 has around 10.2k stars. Given 
TPG's unique focus, it has the potential to attract a niche but highly engaged user base of researchers, engineers, 
and developers in the AI and robotics space.

\section{Reflection on Project Management (LO24)}

\plt{This question focuses on processes and tools used for project management.}

\subsection{How Does Your Project Management Compare to Your Development Plan}

\plt{Did you follow your Development plan, with respect to the team meeting plan, 
team communication plan, team member roles and workflow plan.  Did you use the 
technology you planned on using?}

\subsection{What Went Well?}

\plt{What went well for your project management in terms of processes and 
technology?}

\subsection{What Went Wrong?}

\plt{What went wrong in terms of processes and technology?}

\subsection{What Would you Do Differently Next Time?}

\plt{What will you do differently for your next project?}

\section{Reflection on Capstone}

This section focuses on the key learnings and reflections gained during the course of the capstone project.

\subsection{Which Courses Were Relevant}

Several courses proved highly relevant to the successful completion of our capstone project. Among the most impactful were:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{2AA4 - Introduction to Software Design:} This course provided a foundational understanding of collaborative software development practices. The experience of working on a group project using GitHub, including managing issues, utilizing Kanban boards, and creating pull requests, was invaluable. It instilled the fundamentals of effective team-based development. Furthermore, the emphasis on software design principles, such as SOLID and GRASP, was directly applicable to the capstone project. Although the course was primarily focused on Java, the object-oriented design patterns learned were transferable to our project, which utilized Python and C++. Specifically, we leveraged the Observer pattern to implement a refined logging system within the TPG codebase.

    \item \textbf{3RA3 - Requirements Engineering:} This course provided a solid foundation in defining project requirements prior to implementation. Learning to articulate and prioritize user needs was instrumental in guiding our development efforts. The user-based design principles learned in 3RA3 helped us focus our efforts and prioritize features that aligned with Dr. Kelly's research objectives. The reports we submitted throughout the capstone project mirrored the structure and content of assignments completed in 3RA3, demonstrating the practical application of the course's principles.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Knowledge/Skills Outside of Courses}

Beyond the formal curriculum, our capstone project required the acquisition of specific knowledge and skills in areas not explicitly covered in our coursework. These included:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Genetic Programming:} Gaining an understanding of genetic programming, a specialized research area, was essential. Since none of us had prior exposure to this domain, our learning primarily involved direct instruction from our supervisor, Dr. Kelly, as well as in-depth analysis of the existing TPG codebase. This process required us to quickly grasp complex concepts and apply them to our project.

    \item \textbf{C++ Proficiency:} C++ was the language of choice for performance-critical aspects of the project, a decision driven by Dr. Kelly's preference. While our curriculum included object-oriented languages like Java, C++ was not a primary focus. We therefore had to develop proficiency in C++ independently, leveraging our understanding of object-oriented principles to navigate the language's syntax and intricacies.

    \item \textbf{Docker Containerization:} The project made extensive use of Docker for containerization, a topic not typically covered in our academic coursework. While some of us had gained exposure to Docker during co-op placements, a deeper understanding of how containers work and their benefits was necessary. We independently learned how to install, run, and utilize Docker, developing a valuable skill essential in modern software development workflows. Given the prevalence of containerization in industry, incorporating some introductory material on this topic into the curriculum could benefit future students.
\end{enumerate}
