Date of project start: September 12, 2024

This project is developing an interface to test the evolutionary machine learning framework Tangle Programming Graphs (TPG) in a robotic simulation engine called MuJoCo created by Google Deepmind.

The folders and files for this project are as follows:

`docs` - Documentation for the project
`refs` - Reference material used for the project, including papers
`src` - TPG source code cloned using Git Subtree
`src/src/cpp` - Contains different experiments and models (Classic Control and MuJoCo)
`src/scripts` - Contains environment commands containing useful scripts for running and plotting experiments 
`test` - Test cases

## Background

The code in `src` reproduces results from the paper:

Stephen Kelly, Tatiana Voegerl, Wolfgang Banzhaf, and Cedric Gondro. Evolving Hierarchical Memory-Prediction Machines in Multi-Task Reinforcement Learning. Genetic Programming and Evolvable Machines, 2021.
